# Hi there, I’m **Steven Enamakel** 👋

I’m an engineer specializing in deep-tech, web3, AI. I've been a builder first and a founder second. I'm an optimist and a super workaholic. I sometimes work almost 40 hours straight..

### 🚀 What I've built?

Over the course of the last 10 years I've built many projects in the past. With each project reaching bigger heights than the one before it (and eventually shutting down at a bigger scale as well 😂). But I take all of these expereinces as learnings to improve myself and do better from here on.
